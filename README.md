# DNA Sequence Analysis Tool

This Python script allows you to perform various DNA sequence analysis tasks, including calculating matches, best possible matches with a maximum shift, and finding the maximum contiguous chain. It provides both console input and file input options.

## Features

- Calculate the number of matches between two DNA sequences.
- Find the best possible matches with a maximum shift.
- Determine the maximum contiguous chain in the sequences.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/vp465/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

### Usage

Run the Python script by executing the following command: python main.py


You will be prompted with a menu to choose your options for sequence analysis.

## Menu Options

1. **Calculate matches, best possible matches with maximum shift, and maximum contiguous chain from console input.**

   You will be asked to enter two DNA sequences. The script will calculate the matches without shifts, best possible matches with a maximum shift, and the maximum contiguous chain.

2. **Calculate matches, best possible matches with maximum shift, and maximum contiguous chain from file input.**

   You will be prompted to enter the name of a file containing two DNA sequences separated by newlines. The script will perform the same calculations as option 1.

3. **Exit**

   Exit the program.

## Example File Format

For option 2, the file should contain two DNA sequences separated by newlines. Here is an example file format:

ACGTGACGT
TACGTCGTA
